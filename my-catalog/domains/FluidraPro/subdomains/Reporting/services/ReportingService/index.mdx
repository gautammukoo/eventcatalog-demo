<Steps title="How to connect to Inventory Service">
  <Step title="Obtain API credentials">
    Request API credentials from the Inventory Service team.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Run the following command in your project directory:
    ```bash
    npm install inventory-service-sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the client">
  Use the following code to initialize the Inventory Service client:

```js
const InventoryService = require("inventory-service-sdk");
const client = new InventoryService.Client({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  apiUrl: "https://api.inventoryservice.com/v1",
});
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Make API calls">
  
  You can now use the client to make API calls. For example, to get all products:

```js
client
  .getProducts()
  .then((products) => console.log(products))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

  </Step>
